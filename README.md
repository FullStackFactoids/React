# React Trivia Code Samples Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code samples for various levels of React trivia questions, ranging from beginner to expert. Each trivia question is represented by its own file, containing the code example, explanation, and any additional fun facts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

### Installing React

To install React, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

This will create a new React application in a directory called `my-react-app`. Navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Now, you can start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Running the Code Samples

Each trivia question has its own file, named according to the question number and level of difficulty (e.g., `question_1_level_1.js`).

To run a specific code sample:

1. Copy the code from the trivia question file.
2. Replace the content of the `App.js` file in your React project with the copied code.
3. Save the file.
4. Your development server should automatically reload, displaying the output of the code sample.
